      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our paper on the analysis of smart home IoT devices while not in active use has been accepted at PerCom 2025! This is Christian&amp;rsquo;s first paper accepted at a conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Smart Home Exchanged 3M Messages: Defining and Analyzing Smart Device Passive Mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Badolato (University of Maryland, Baltimore County), Kaur Kullman (University of Maryland, Baltimore County), Nikolaos Papadakis (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), Manav Bhatt (University of Maryland, Baltimore County), Georgios Bouloukakis (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), Don Engel (University of Maryland, Baltimore County), and Roberto Yus (University of Maryland, Baltimore County)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constant connectedness of smart home devices and their sensing capabilities pose a unique threat to individuals&#39; privacy. While users may expect devices to exhibit minimal activity while they are not performing their intended functions, this is not necessarily the case, and traditional idle mode designations are insufficient to address the current landscape of smart home devices. To address this we propose a designation based on a comprehensive categorization of smart home devices. We then measure the network traffic of thirty-two devices in their respective passive modes. We find that 97% of the devices exhibit near-constant network activity in these modes (exchanging over 3M messages in 24 hours), with many of the devices initiating and responding to LAN communications with other devices, which potentially exposes users to privacy leakages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Passive Mode for IoT</title>
      <link>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/iotpassivemode/</link>

      <guid>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/iotpassivemode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional &amp;ldquo;idle&amp;rdquo; mode designations lack the granularity required to fully describe the behaviors of non-active IoT devices. For example, there is a notable difference between a smart speaker having its microphone muted and it idly listening for a voice command. This is demonstrated by manufacturers&#39; inclusions of &amp;ldquo;privacy modes&amp;rdquo; in smart devices such as cameras. The ambiguity surrounding the expected behavior of device idle states implies the existence of a logical &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; state which describes the expected behavior of the devices themselves. Despite this, no accepted standards exist to define such a state. This hinders researchers&#39; abilities to compare devices&#39; non-active behaviors, requires manufacturers spend resources to define their own passive states, reduces transparency in data privacy practices by encouraging the creation of proprietary mode definitions, and places a significant burden on users to understand the individual privacy implications of each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to provide a formal definition for these passive modes which can enable straightforward construction of device-specific definitions. We further study the passive mode behavior of these devices to determine the gap between the observed behaviors and a truely &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for 40% to 50% of energy usage in commercial buildings. Thus, innovative ways to control and manage HVAC systems while preserving occupants&#39; comfort are required. State-of-the-art solutions employ pervasive systems with sensors or smart devices to gauge individual thermal sensations, yet assessing these methods is challenging. Real-world experiments are expensive, limited in access, and often overlook occupant and regional diversity. To address this, we introduce Co-zyBench, a benchmark tool using a Digital Twin (DT) approach for evaluating personalized thermal comfort systems. It employs a co-simulation middleware interfacing between a DT of the smart building and its HVAC system and another DT representing occupants&#39; dynamic thermal preferences in various spaces. The DTs that support Co-zyBench are generated based on information, including data captured by sensors, of the space in which the thermal comfort system has to be evaluated. Co-zyBench incorporates metrics for energy consumption, thermal comfort, and occupant equality. It also features reference DTs based on standard buildings, HVAC systems, and occupants with diverse thermal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy policies of websites are often lengthy and intricate. Privacy assistants assist in simplifying policies and making them more accessible and user-friendly. The emergence of generative AI (genAI) offers new opportunities to build privacy assistants that can answer users&#39; questions about privacy policies. However, genAI&amp;rsquo;s reliability is a concern due to its potential for producing inaccurate information. This study introduces GenAIPABench, a benchmark for evaluating Generative AI-based Privacy Assistants (GenAIPAs). GenAIPABench includes: 1) A set of questions about privacy policies and data protection regulations, with annotated answers for various organizations and regulations; 2) Metrics to assess the accuracy, relevance, and consistency of responses; and 3) A tool for generating prompts to introduce privacy documents and varied privacy questions to test system robustness. We evaluated three leading genAI systems—ChatGPT-4, Bard, and Bing AI—using GenAIPABench to gauge their effectiveness as GenAIPAs. Our results demonstrate significant promise in genAI capabilities in the privacy domain while also highlighting challenges in managing complex queries, ensuring consistency, and verifying source accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our paper on a benchmark to evaluate thermal comfort provision systems on smart buildings has been accepted at the 1st International Workshop on Middleware for Digital Twin (Midd4DT) collocated with Middleware 2023. More information at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hakiri.github.io/Midd4DT/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Midd4DT 2023 website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a significant portion of energy consumption within buildings. In order to balance the effect of thermal comfort vis-a-vis energy savings, HVAC control strategies have been proposed. However, the strategies are static and do not take into account dynamic changes of consumers, hence creating sub-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes DEMSA, a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled middleware for the self-adaptation of smart buildings. The DEMSA middleware interconnects and coordinates intelligent data exchange between the building edge server, digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning nodes in order to invoke appropriate strategies. Moreover, DEMSA is paired with a self-adaptive mechanism that can detect the anomaly of generated planning and adaptively modify it. This process ensures balancing building energy consumption and thermal comfort requirements, without human intervention. The DEMSA middleware is described over a real smart space scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Through the transformation of raw quantitative data captured by decibel, degree, and motion sensors into human-comprehensible notions, such as noise level, temperature, and occupancy level, we are capable of determining the most optimal work location for users based on their comfortability preferences. We anticipate uncovering valuable trends related to user preferences and the effectiveness of our data collection, translation, and protection processes. Looking ahead, we envision deploying our product in the library at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) to provide a valuable resource that enhances the study processes for UMBC students. As our research unfolds, we hope to continue improving user comfort in work and positively impacting daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the age of data-driven technology, privacy has emerged as a critical concern for both users
and organizations. Privacy policies are widely used to outline the data management practices of
a company. However, it has been demonstrated that privacy policies, as well as regulations, are
generally too complex for people, which motivates the need for privacy assistants. The emergence
of generative AI (genAI) technology presents an opportunity to improve the capabilities of privacy
assistants to answer questions people might have about their privacy. However, while textual genAI
technology generates content that seems accurate, it is been shown that it can generate fake/incorrect
information (e.g., due to its tendency to hallucinate) which might mislead the user. This paper
presents, GENAIPABENCH, a novel privacy benchmark to evaluate the performance of generative
AI-based privacy assistants (GenAIPAs). GENAIPABENCH includes: 1. A comprehensive set of
questions about an organization’s privacy policy along with annotated answers and data protection
regulation questions; 2. A set of metrics to evaluate the answers obtained from the generative AI
system; 3. An evaluation tool that generates appropriate prompts to introduce the system to the
privacy document and different variations of the privacy questions to evaluate its robustness. We
present an evaluation of OpenAI’s ChatGPT using GENAIPABENCH. Our findings indicate that
ChatGPT holds considerable promise as a privacy agent, although it experiences challenges such as
handling complex tasks, ensuring response consistency, and accurately referencing the information provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As the adoption of smart devices continues to permeate all
aspects of our lives, concerns surrounding user privacy have
become more pertinent than ever before. While privacy policies define the data management practices of their manufacturers, previous work has shown that they are rarely read and
understood by users. Hence, automatic analysis of privacy
policies has been shown to help provide users with appropriate insights. Previous research has extensively analyzed
privacy policies of websites, e-commerce, and mobile applications, but privacy policies of smart devices, present some
differences and specific challenges such as the difficulty to
find and collect them. We present PrivacyLens, a novel framework for discovering and collecting past, present, and future
smart device privacy policies and harnessing NLP and ML algorithms to analyze them. PrivacyLens is currently deployed,
collecting, analyzing, and publishing insights about privacy
policies to assist different stakeholders of smart devices, such
as users, policy authors, and regulators. We show several examples of analytical tasks enabled by PrivacyLens, including
comparisons of devices per type and manufacturing country,
categorization of privacy policies, and impact of data regulations on data practices. At the time of submitting this paper,
PrivacyLens had collected and analyzed more than 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PrivacyLens is a novel framework devised to automatically collect, analyze, and publish privacy policies of smart IoT devices, responding to the growing concerns over user privacy as smart devices become increasingly integrated into daily lives. Despite the existence of privacy policies, a significant challenge arises as they are often overlooked or misunderstood by users, hence the need for an automated analysis to provide clearer insights to users and other stakeholders. Unlike previous works, this project pivots towards addressing the gap in privacy policies specific to smart devices which present unique challenges in collection and analysis due to their dispersed nature across various manufacturers and e-commerce platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PrivacyLens framework operates in three core stages; Collection, Analysis, and Publication. Initially, it crawls prominent e-commerce sites for smart IoT devices, extracting metadata and privacy policies, while also utilizing the Wayback Machine to garner historical privacy policies for longitudinal analysis. Following the collection, the framework employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to dissect these policies, aiming to deduce features like overall quality, readability, and ambiguity among others. The final stage sees the publishing of this analyzed data on a dedicated website, updated monthly to provide users, policy authors, and regulators a robust, updated resource to understand and compare privacy practices across a multitude of smart devices. As of the submission, PrivacyLens has successfully amassed and analyzed over 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart devices, presenting a significant stride towards fostering transparency and informed decision-making in the realm of smart device privacy. Through PrivacyLens, stakeholders varying from ordinary consumers to data protection regulators are equipped with a powerful tool to understand and navigate the privacy landscape of IoT devices, marking a crucial step towards creating a more responsible and transparent digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sragvi Nidamarti successfully defended his Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis &amp;lsquo;Addressing Trust Concerns in the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain: A
Knowledge Graph Approach&amp;rsquo;. The study discusses the socio-economic impact of EV batteries and addresses the trust concerns surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee : Roberto Yus (University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA) ; Tim Finnin (University of Maryland, Baltimore County) ; Manas Gaur(University of Maryland, Baltimore County); Konstantinos Mersinas (Royal Holloway University of London)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are increasingly interested in electric vehicles in comparison to gasoline vehicles, resulting in a significant rise in sales in recent years. This change is
heavily attributed to factors such as high-quality manufacturing and environmental concerns. However, customers may have concerns regarding the eco-friendliness of
the manufacturing process involved and the socio-economic impact (labor law violations) of batteries, possibly due to the newness of the technology involved and a
lack of transparency in the process and supply chain. This thesis presents a system to help build trust around this concern. It has a knowledge graph that acts
as a base representing standard elements of trust, constructed as an integration of state-of-the-art ontologies in the field. It also includes knowledge about the manufacturing process and the supply chain. With this information, the system uses a
mechanism to address the concerns using SPARQL queries that can, among others, label potential trust issues in the manufacturing of electric vehicles. We showcase a
use case in which we identify trust issues in certain popular EV manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our undergrad team looking at privacy issues on smart homes (Tartela, Luke, Ruhshana, and Josh) will present a poster during UMBC&amp;rsquo;s Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Day (URCAD) 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyzing Privacy and Utility Tradeoffs in Smart Homes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tartela Tabassum, Luke Zimmermann, Ruhshana Bobojonova, Joshua Cheeks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research is to explore the trade-off that exists between privacy and utility when using smart devices at home. Smart speakers, doorbells, and TVs are becoming pervasive but raise important privacy concerns. For instance, by collecting audio and video, one could learn private information about us such as our age, emotions, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. To increase trust, there is a need to inform people about potentially sensitive inferences that can be made about them by smart devices and give them a choice to consent to it. We have built a prototype of a framework, using open-source code and AI/ML algorithms, that generates inferences about an individual based on audio (e.g., speech data collected by a smart speaker) and video (e.g., images collected by a smart security camera). The framework also allows the user to select which of these inferences should be &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo;. We have explored different mechanisms to hide those inferences while preserving utility such as: removing specific portions of audio/video that can lead to whether the person might be facing a respiratory disease or modifying the pitch/tone to hide their age and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-Shot Federated Group Collaborative Filtering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maksim E. Eren (UMBC/LANL), Manish Bhattarai (LANL), Nicholas Solovyev (LANL), Luke E. Richards (UMBC), Roberto Yus (UMBC), Charles Nicholas (UMBC), Boian S. Alexandrov (LANL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with missing-value completion is a well-known effective Collaborative Filtering (CF) method used to provide personalized user recommendations. However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two MovieLens datasets. One-FedCF can obtain results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents Sentaur, a middleware designed, built, and deployed to support sensor-based smart space analytical applications. Sentaur supports a powerful data model that decouples semantic data (about the application domain) from sensor data (using which the semantic data is derived). By supporting mechanisms to map/translate data, concepts, and queries between the two levels, Sentaur relieves application developers from having to know or reason about either capabilities of sensors or write sensor specific code. This paper describes Sentaur data model, its translation strategy, and highlights its benefits through real-world case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JENNER:  Just-in-time Enrichment in Query Processing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, Peeyush Gupta, and Sharad Mehrotra (University of California, Irvine); Roberto Yus (University of Maryland, Baltimore County); and Yasser Altowim (Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging domains, such as sensor-driven smart spaces and social media analytics, require incoming data to be enriched prior to its use. Enrichment often consists of machine learning (ML) functions that are too expensive/infeasible to execute at ingestion. We develop a strategy entitled Just-in-time ENrichmeNt in quERy Processing (JENNER) to support interactive analytics over data as soon as it arrives for such application context. JENNER exploits the inherent tradeoffs of cost and quality often displayed by the ML functions to  progressively improve query answers during query execution. We describe how JENNER works for a large class of SPJ and aggregation queries that form the bulk of  data analytics workload. Our experimental results on real datasets (IoT and Tweet) show that JENNER achieves progressive answers performing significantly better than the naive strategies of achieving progressive computation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SemIoTic Ecosystem: A Semantic Bridge between IoT Devices and Smart Spaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberto Yus (University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA); Georgios Bouloukakis (Telecom SudParis, USA); Sharad Mehrotra and Nalini Venkatasubramanian (University of California, Irvine, USA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart space administration and application development is challenging in part due to the semantic gap that exists between the high-level requirements of users and the low-level capabilities of IoT devices. The stakeholders in a smart space are required to deal with communicating with specific IoT devices, capturing data, processing it, and abstracting it out to generate useful inferences. Additionally, this makes reusability of smart space applications difficult since they are developed for specific sensor deployments. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to IoT smart spaces, the SemIoTic ecosystem, to facilitate application development, space management, and service provision to its inhabitants. The ecosystem is based on a centralized repository, where developers can advertise their space-agnostic applications; and a SemIoTic system deployed in each smart space that interacts with those applications to provide them with the required information. SemIoTic applications are developed using a metamodel that defines high-level concepts abstracted from the smart space about the space itself and the people within it. Application requirements can be expressed then in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts which are automatically translated by SemIoTic into sensor/actuator commands adapted to the underlying device deployment in each space. We present a reference implementation of the ecosystem that has been deployed at the University of California, Irvine and is abstracting data from hundreds of sensors in the space and providing applications to campus members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartSPEC: Customizable Smart Space Datasets via Event-Driven Simulations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Chio (University of California, Irvine, USA); Daokun Jiang (Google); Peeyush Gupta (University of California, Irvine, USA); Georgios Bouloukakis (Telecom SudParis, USA); Roberto Yus (University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA); Sharad Mehrotra and Nalini Venkatasubramanian (University of California, Irvine, USA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents SmartSPEC, an approach to generate customizable smart space datasets using sensorized spaces in which people and events are embedded. Smart space datasets are critical to design, deploy and evaluate robust systems and applications to ensure cost-effective operation and safety/comfort/convenience of the space occupants. Often, real-world data is difficult to obtain due to the lack of fine-grained sensing; privacy/security concerns prevent the release and sharing of individual and spatial data. SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that can create a digital representation (twin) of a smart space and its activities. SmartSPEC uses a semantic model and ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes in a sensorized space, and applies an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc). To evaluate the realism of the data generated by SmartSPEC, we develop a structured methodology and metrics to assess various aspects of smart space datasets, including trajectories of people and occupancy of spaces. Our experimental study looks at two real-world settings/datasets: an instrumented smart campus building and a city-wide GPS dataset. Our results show that the trajectories produced by SmartSPEC are 1.4x to 4.4x more realistic than the best synthetic data baseline when compared to real-world data, depending on the scenario and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that creates customizable smart space datasets using semantic models of spaces, people, events and sensors. We employ ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes of the embedded people and events in a sensorized space and apply an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SmartSPEC architecture consists of two main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Learning, which uses input seed connectivity data and a priori knowledge of the underlying space and sensors to learn high-order concepts of events, people and trajectories, which we refer to as &amp;ldquo;metaevents&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;metapeople&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metatrajectories&amp;rdquo;, respectively; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Generation, which takes SmartSPEC data to generate a synthetic dataset from which a smart space dataset (e.g., trajectory dataset, sensor observation dataset, etc.) can be derived. We use the variations of the data models described below to define various scenarios, which drives the generation of new observable phenomena in the smart space.&lt;/p&gt;

Smart space datasets are critical to design, deploy and evaluate robust systems and applications to ensure cost-effective operation and safety/comfort/convenience of the space occupants. Often, real-world data is difficult to obtain due to the lack of fine-grained sensing; privacy/security concerns prevent the release and sharing of individual and spatial data.

      <guid>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/semiotic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space 
while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators. SemIoTic uses a metamodel based on the popular 
SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices&#39; world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts 
(i.e., observable attributes of users and spaces). It supports a language where users can express their action requirements (i.e., requests for sensor data, commands 
for actuators, and privacy preferences) in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts. We present an ontology-based algorithmic approach to translate user-defined actions 
into sensor/actuators commands. Finally, our end-to-end approach includes a cross-layer solution to provide interoperability with diverse IoT devices and their data exchange protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several instances of SemIoTic have been deployed and used in IoT spaces. At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants 
have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19.
Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) 
in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple 
regions of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;useful-links-and-references&#34;&gt;Useful links and references&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SemIoTic is developed as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tippers.ics.uci.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TIPPERS&lt;/a&gt; (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.&lt;/li&gt;
