Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative group environment.\nSee more about our group policies.\nGraduate Students If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in pursuing a Ph.D. with either direct or general admit, or in thesis or project-based masters research, reach out to Prof. Yus by email with your: (1) CV, (2) a description of research experience and interests, and (3) specific information about why the DAMS group interests you.\nApplying to our graduate program If you are interested in applying to the UMBC Computer Science graduate program, please check the information our the CSEE Grad programs. Graduate admissions are done by a central Departmental committee that processes all applications and decides on admissions for the entire department. Individual faculty members may not accept students on their own but reach out to Prof. Yus by email if you are interested in applying and potentially being part of the DAMS group.\nUndergraduate Students Students majoring in Computer Science are encouraged to apply.\n Previous research experience is not required. Students must be able to work an average of 10 hour per week. Demonstrated leadership and collaboration experience is a plus. Strong communication skills (written and oral) are a plus. Knowledge of programming languages (e.g., Java, Python), Web development (e.g., HTML, Javascript, React), and Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) are a plus.  Why do research? Through undergraduate research, you’ll: 1) learn about the latest questions currently under scientific investigation and approaches being used to tackle them, 2) help solve real and important scientific problems, and 3) gain valuable experience in critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication.\nWhat will you do? The DAMS Group is focused on designing mechanisms to make IoT systems bridge the gap between user requirements and IoT device capabilities. Undergraduate researchers will generally work on projects related to the research areas of the group: 1) Data Management, 2) AI (Knowledge Representation \u0026amp; Reasoning), and 3) Privacy. These may involve activities such as interacting with IoT devices and systems, writing code to extract insights from sensor data, integrate ML algorithms within an IoT system, etc.\nWhat are the hours for the position? Apart from attendance at weekly group meetings, students are free to work according to a flexible schedule. So far during COVID, all work has been remote, though we do have a lab office available.\nHow do I apply? If you’re interested in applying for a lab position or for research credit, you must read the DAMS Group Undergraduate Research Agreement carefully to make sure you understand what’s involved. Then include in a single email: (1) your resume (PDF), (2) unofficial copy of your transcript (PDF); freshman can send high school transcript (PDF), and (3) one page or less explaining why you\u0026rsquo;d like to work in our lab (PDF).

Despite the existence of privacy policies, a significant challenge arises as they are often overlooked or misunderstood by users, hence the need for an automated analysis to provide clearer insights to users and other stakeholders. Unlike previous works, this project pivots towards addressing the gap in privacy policies specific to smart devices which present unique challenges in collection and analysis due to their dispersed nature across various manufacturers and e-commerce platforms.\nThe PrivacyLens framework operates in three core stages; Collection, Analysis, and Publication. Initially, it crawls prominent e-commerce sites for smart IoT devices, extracting metadata and privacy policies, while also utilizing the Wayback Machine to garner historical privacy policies for longitudinal analysis. Following the collection, the framework employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to dissect these policies, aiming to deduce features like overall quality, readability, and ambiguity among others. The final stage sees the publishing of this analyzed data on a dedicated website, updated monthly to provide users, policy authors, and regulators a robust, updated resource to understand and compare privacy practices across a multitude of smart devices.

While privacy policies define the data management practices of their manufacturers, previous work has shown that they are rarely read and understood by users. Hence, automatic analysis of privacy policies has been shown to help provide users with appropriate insights. Previous research has extensively analyzed privacy policies of websites, e-commerce, and mobile applications, but privacy policies of smart devices, present some differences and specific challenges such as the difficulty to find and collect them. We present PrivacyLens, a novel framework for discovering and collecting past, present, and future smart device privacy policies and harnessing NLP and ML algorithms to analyze them. PrivacyLens is currently deployed, collecting, analyzing, and publishing insights about privacy policies to assist different stakeholders of smart devices, such as users, policy authors, and regulators. We show several examples of analytical tasks enabled by PrivacyLens, including comparisons of devices per type and manufacturing country, categorization of privacy policies, and impact of data regulations on data practices. At the time of submitting this paper, PrivacyLens had collected and analyzed more than 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart devices.","tags":["Internet of Things","Privacy","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"PrivacyLens: A Framework to Collect and Analyze the Landscape of Past, Present, and Future Smart Device Privacy Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sragvi Nidamarti successfully defended his Master\u0026rsquo;s Thesis \u0026lsquo;Addressing Trust Concerns in the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain: A Knowledge Graph Approach\u0026rsquo;.

This change is heavily attributed to factors such as high-quality manufacturing and environmental concerns. However, customers may have concerns regarding the eco-friendliness of the manufacturing process involved and the socio-economic impact (labor law violations) of batteries, possibly due to the newness of the technology involved and a lack of transparency in the process and supply chain. This thesis presents a system to help build trust around this concern. It has a knowledge graph that acts as a base representing standard elements of trust, constructed as an integration of state-of-the-art ontologies in the field. It also includes knowledge about the manufacturing process and the supply chain. With this information, the system uses a mechanism to address the concerns using SPARQL queries that can, among others, label potential trust issues in the manufacturing of electric vehicles. We showcase a use case in which we identify trust issues in certain popular EV manufacturers.\n","date":1690416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690416000,"objectID":"bdc4d8c29fd0494446dca1b4f1d15dfe","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/post/07-27-2023-thesis-defense/","publishdate":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/07-27-2023-thesis-defense/","section":"post","summary":"Sragvi Nidamarti successfully defended his Master\u0026rsquo;s Thesis \u0026lsquo;Addressing Trust Concerns in the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain: A Knowledge Graph Approach\u0026rsquo;.

Smart speakers, doorbells, and TVs are becoming pervasive but raise important privacy concerns. For instance, by collecting audio and video, one could learn private information about us such as our age, emotions, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. To increase trust, there is a need to inform people about potentially sensitive inferences that can be made about them by smart devices and give them a choice to consent to it. We have built a prototype of a framework, using open-source code and AI/ML algorithms, that generates inferences about an individual based on audio (e.g., speech data collected by a smart speaker) and video (e.g., images collected by a smart security camera). The framework also allows the user to select which of these inferences should be \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo;. We have explored different mechanisms to hide those inferences while preserving utility such as: removing specific portions of audio/video that can lead to whether the person might be facing a respiratory disease or modifying the pitch/tone to hide their age and mood.\n","date":1678233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678233600,"objectID":"063ad8efdcfdab348e431343a75c4625","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/post/3-8-2023-umbc-urcad/","publishdate":"2023-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/3-8-2023-umbc-urcad/","section":"post","summary":"Our undergrad team looking at privacy issues on smart homes (Tartela, Luke, Ruhshana, and Josh) will present a poster during UMBC\u0026rsquo;s Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Day (URCAD) 2023.\nAnalyzing Privacy and Utility Tradeoffs in Smart Homes\nTartela Tabassum, Luke Zimmermann, Ruhshana Bobojonova, Joshua Cheeks\n","tags":null,"title":"Poster accepted for presentation at UMBC's URCAD 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":["Maksim E.

We present a reference implementation of the ecosystem that has been deployed at the University of California, Irvine and is abstracting data from hundreds of sensors in the space and providing applications to campus members.","tags":["Internet of Things","Semantic interoperability","End-to-end interoperability","Open APIs","Smart Buildings","Middleware"],"title":"The SemIoTic Ecosystem: A Semantic Bridge between IoT Devices and Smart Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Chio","Daokun Jiang","Peeyush Gupta","Georgios Bouloukakis","Roberto Yus","Sharad Mehrotra","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647475200,"objectID":"1d57201a400934ac26f78779890b1418","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/publication/percom-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/percom-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents SmartSPEC, an approach to generate customizable smart space datasets with information about sensorized spaces in which people and events are em- bedded.

WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points (APs), each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning tasks - frst, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. LOCATER uses a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for coarse localization and a probabilistic method to achieve fner localization. The paper shows that LOCATER can achieve signifcantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fne levels.","tags":["Data Management","Internet of Things"],"title":"LOCATER: Cleaning WiFi Connectivity Datasets for Semantic Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael August","Christopher Davison","Mamadou H.

We present Sieve, a layered approach of implementing FGAC in existing DBMSs, that exploits a variety of their features (e.g., UDFs, index usage hints, query explain) to scale to a large number of policies. Given a query, Sieve exploits its context to filter the policies that need to be checked. It also generates guarded expressions that save on evaluation cost by grouping policies and exploit database indices to cut on read cost. Our experimental results demonstrate that existing DBMSs can utilize Sieve to significantly reduce query-time policy evaluation cost.

To provide such services, IoT systems need to handle data captured from multiple devices/sensors, and translation of data processing policies agreed by users (high-level) into commands for devices (device-level). The underlying assumption is that users trust IoT systems in honoring their policies. However, this trust assumption is incorrectly positioned since IoT systems may not be honest or may fall victim to cyberattacks. We address such concerns by providing mechanisms to help in ensuring trust and accountability at the time of translating a contract (agreed and signed policies). The objective of the proposed scheme is two fold, (1) translation of contracts from a high-level to device-level, (2) attestation of the translation. We have implemented the proposed scheme for contract translation and attestation of translation as a module and integrated it with the TIPPERS system (our IoT testbed under development).
