      <title>Passive Mode for IoT</title>
      <link>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/iotpassivemode/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional &amp;ldquo;idle&amp;rdquo; mode designations lack the granularity required to fully describe the behaviors of non-active IoT devices. For example, there is a notable difference between a smart speaker having its microphone muted and it idly listening for a voice command. This is demonstrated by manufacturers&#39; inclusions of &amp;ldquo;privacy modes&amp;rdquo; in smart devices such as cameras. The ambiguity surrounding the expected behavior of device idle states implies the existence of a logical &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; state which describes the expected behavior of the devices themselves. Despite this, no accepted standards exist to define such a state. This hinders researchers&#39; abilities to compare devices&#39; non-active behaviors, requires manufacturers spend resources to define their own passive states, reduces transparency in data privacy practices by encouraging the creation of proprietary mode definitions, and places a significant burden on users to understand the individual privacy implications of each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to provide a formal definition for these passive modes which can enable straightforward construction of device-specific definitions. We further study the passive mode behavior of these devices to determine the gap between the observed behaviors and a truely &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GenAIPABench</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy policies of websites are often lengthy and intricate. Privacy assistants assist in simplifying policies and making them more accessible and user-friendly. The emergence of generative AI (genAI) offers new opportunities to build privacy assistants that can answer users&#39; questions about privacy policies. However, genAI&amp;rsquo;s reliability is a concern due to its potential for producing inaccurate information. This study introduces GenAIPABench, a benchmark for evaluating Generative AI-based Privacy Assistants (GenAIPAs). GenAIPABench includes: 1) A set of questions about privacy policies and data protection regulations, with annotated answers for various organizations and regulations; 2) Metrics to assess the accuracy, relevance, and consistency of responses; and 3) A tool for generating prompts to introduce privacy documents and varied privacy questions to test system robustness. We evaluated three leading genAI systems—ChatGPT-4, Bard, and Bing AI—using GenAIPABench to gauge their effectiveness as GenAIPAs. Our results demonstrate significant promise in genAI capabilities in the privacy domain while also highlighting challenges in managing complex queries, ensuring consistency, and verifying source accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PrivacyLens</title>
      <link>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/privacylens/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PrivacyLens is a novel framework devised to automatically collect, analyze, and publish privacy policies of smart IoT devices, responding to the growing concerns over user privacy as smart devices become increasingly integrated into daily lives. Despite the existence of privacy policies, a significant challenge arises as they are often overlooked or misunderstood by users, hence the need for an automated analysis to provide clearer insights to users and other stakeholders. Unlike previous works, this project pivots towards addressing the gap in privacy policies specific to smart devices which present unique challenges in collection and analysis due to their dispersed nature across various manufacturers and e-commerce platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PrivacyLens framework operates in three core stages; Collection, Analysis, and Publication. Initially, it crawls prominent e-commerce sites for smart IoT devices, extracting metadata and privacy policies, while also utilizing the Wayback Machine to garner historical privacy policies for longitudinal analysis. Following the collection, the framework employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to dissect these policies, aiming to deduce features like overall quality, readability, and ambiguity among others. The final stage sees the publishing of this analyzed data on a dedicated website, updated monthly to provide users, policy authors, and regulators a robust, updated resource to understand and compare privacy practices across a multitude of smart devices. As of the submission, PrivacyLens has successfully amassed and analyzed over 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart devices, presenting a significant stride towards fostering transparency and informed decision-making in the realm of smart device privacy. Through PrivacyLens, stakeholders varying from ordinary consumers to data protection regulators are equipped with a powerful tool to understand and navigate the privacy landscape of IoT devices, marking a crucial step towards creating a more responsible and transparent digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that creates customizable smart space datasets using semantic models of spaces, people, events and sensors. We employ ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes of the embedded people and events in a sensorized space and apply an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SmartSPEC architecture consists of two main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Learning, which uses input seed connectivity data and a priori knowledge of the underlying space and sensors to learn high-order concepts of events, people and trajectories, which we refer to as &amp;ldquo;metaevents&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;metapeople&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metatrajectories&amp;rdquo;, respectively; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Generation, which takes SmartSPEC data to generate a synthetic dataset from which a smart space dataset (e.g., trajectory dataset, sensor observation dataset, etc.) can be derived. We use the variations of the data models described below to define various scenarios, which drives the generation of new observable phenomena in the smart space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SemIoTic</title>
      <link>https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/semiotic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space 
while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators. SemIoTic uses a metamodel based on the popular 
SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices&#39; world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts 
(i.e., observable attributes of users and spaces). It supports a language where users can express their action requirements (i.e., requests for sensor data, commands 
for actuators, and privacy preferences) in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts. We present an ontology-based algorithmic approach to translate user-defined actions 
into sensor/actuators commands. Finally, our end-to-end approach includes a cross-layer solution to provide interoperability with diverse IoT devices and their data exchange protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several instances of SemIoTic have been deployed and used in IoT spaces. At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants 
have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19.
Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) 
in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple 
regions of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;useful-links-and-references&#34;&gt;Useful links and references&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SemIoTic is developed as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tippers.ics.uci.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TIPPERS&lt;/a&gt; (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.&lt;/li&gt;
